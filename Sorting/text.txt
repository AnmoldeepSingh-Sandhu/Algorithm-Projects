1. Random string

I just created a s string which have a to z characters in it which will make easy to create random string.
Then, (in generate_sv()) I just generate randow number upto 1 (16 times). If the number is 0 add lower case character to 
random string otherwise add uppercase character.

After that I use kind of selection sort to put lowercase letters on beginning and and shift all other characters one back.
Then just repeat this process to sort it.

It run 61 times.

O(n)




2. Vectors
 
I just created 3 empty Vectors in the main and then fill the v1(ascending) and v2(decending) with random numbers.
Then fill cs vectors first 8 positions with v1 values and remaining with v2 values.

Then, I use selection sort to sort cs vector because it is easy one to write due to less code and it is also easy to understand.

It run 120 times.

O(n^2)


so, cs vector took more time than random_s string to solve.
